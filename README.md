## Project 1: Meaningful User Sentiment Classifier

This project is a meta-analysis asking the following question:

“What are the phrases and terms associated with the positive, mixed-positive,
neutral, negative health IT programs? Are there any patterns in the data that
can correctly predict the effectiveness of a new study?”

For documentation on the dataset we will use for this analysis, see this
